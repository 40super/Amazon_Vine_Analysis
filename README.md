## Summary

When looking at the data for Vine reviews, I believe there is no bias towards reviews due to the percentage be less than 50 percent. With more data, the bias could change but with the limited data available, there is no biases towards the reviews. One extra analysis that could of helped is comparing the helpful votes that was attached to the 5 star reviews for both Vine and non-Vine reviews. The reason is that if there are higher percentage of reviews with higher helpful vote counts, this could show that wheter Vine reviews are more impactful than non-Vine reviews.
